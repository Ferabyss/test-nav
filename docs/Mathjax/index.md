The following document is to test $$\LaTeX$$ rendering with
[just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) on GitHub Pages.

It was copied from a
[test](https://github.com/atom-community/markdown-preview-plus/blob/master/EXAMPLE.md)
in [markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus),
and adjusted to use
[kramdown math blocks](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#math-blocks).
